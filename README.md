# Spaceborne-Wide-Area-Electromagnetic-Spectrum-Map-Dataset
Based on spaceborne synthetic aperture passive interference imaging technology, a mapping of the electromagnetic spectrum distribution of 5,000 randomly distributed ground radiation sources globally has been conducted, resulting in a space-based wide-area electromagnetic spectrum dataset containing 2,940 maps.
